# WebSocket Protocol

## Definition
WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server with lower overhead than traditional HTTP polling.

## RFCs and Standards
- **RFC 6455**: The WebSocket Protocol (December 2011)
- **RFC 7692**: Compression Extensions for WebSocket (December 2015)
- **RFC 8441**: Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/2 (September 2018)

## Why WebSocket Matters
WebSocket addresses limitations of traditional HTTP request-response patterns:
- **Real-time communication**: Instant bidirectional data exchange
- **Lower latency**: No HTTP overhead for each message
- **Persistent connection**: Single connection for entire session
- **Server-initiated messages**: Server can push data without client request
- **Reduced bandwidth**: Minimal frame overhead compared to HTTP headers

## Real-World Engineering Scenario

### Scenario: Real-Time Trading Platform
A financial trading platform needs to deliver live market data and execute trades with minimal latency.

**Challenge**: Traditional HTTP polling creates unacceptable latency and server load for real-time price updates.

**HTTP Polling Problems**:
```
Traditional Approach:
1. Client polls every 100ms: GET /api/prices
2. Server responds with current prices
3. 90% of requests return "no change"
4. High server load, bandwidth waste
5. 100ms+ latency for price updates
```

**WebSocket Solution**:
```
WebSocket Implementation:
1. Single handshake: HTTP â†’ WebSocket upgrade
2. Server pushes price updates instantly
3. Client sends trade orders immediately
4. Bidirectional real-time communication
5. <10ms latency for critical updates
```

**Implementation Results**:
- 95% reduction in server requests
- 80% reduction in bandwidth usage
- 90% improvement in update latency
- Real-time order execution capability
- Better user experience and trading performance

## Key WebSocket Features

### Protocol Upgrade
- HTTP/1.1 upgrade mechanism
- Handshake with Sec-WebSocket-Key
- Connection establishment process
- Protocol switching from HTTP to WebSocket

### Frame-Based Communication
- Binary and text frame types
- Control frames (ping, pong, close)
- Message fragmentation support
- Flow control mechanisms

### Real-Time Applications
- Live chat and messaging
- Real-time gaming
- Live data feeds
- Collaborative editing
- IoT device communication

## Code Examples
- `websocket_server.py` - WebSocket server implementation and message handling
- `websocket_client.py` - WebSocket client connection and communication patterns
- `websocket_applications.py` - Real-world WebSocket application scenarios

## Run Instructions
```bash
make test    # Run all WebSocket demonstrations
make deps    # Check HTTP/1.1 dependencies
```

WebSocket enables true real-time web applications by providing persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication channels, making it essential for modern interactive web experiences and real-time data applications.
