# HTTP/3 Protocol

## Definition
HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, built on top of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP. It provides improved performance, reduced latency, and better connection resilience compared to HTTP/2.

## RFCs and Standards
- **RFC 9114**: HTTP/3 (June 2022)
- **RFC 9000**: QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport Protocol
- **RFC 9001**: Using TLS to Secure QUIC
- **RFC 9002**: QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control

## Why HTTP/3 Matters
HTTP/3 addresses fundamental limitations of TCP-based protocols:
- **Head-of-line blocking elimination**: QUIC streams are independent at transport layer
- **Faster connection establishment**: 0-RTT and 1-RTT handshakes
- **Connection migration**: Survives IP address changes (mobile networks)
- **Improved loss recovery**: Per-stream flow control and congestion control
- **Built-in encryption**: TLS 1.3 integrated into QUIC

## Real-World Engineering Scenario

### Scenario: Global CDN Migration to HTTP/3
A major video streaming platform migrates from HTTP/2 to HTTP/3 to improve mobile user experience.

**Challenge**: Mobile users experience frequent connection drops and rebuffering due to network switching (WiFi ↔ cellular) and TCP head-of-line blocking during packet loss.

**HTTP/2 Problems**:
```
Mobile User Journey:
1. Start video on WiFi (HTTP/2 over TCP)
2. Walk outside → switch to cellular
3. TCP connection breaks → full reconnection required
4. Packet loss → all streams blocked waiting for retransmission
5. Poor user experience, high abandonment rate
```

**HTTP/3 Solution**:
```
QUIC Connection Migration:
1. Start video on WiFi (HTTP/3 over QUIC)
2. Walk outside → switch to cellular
3. QUIC connection migrates seamlessly using connection ID
4. Packet loss → only affected stream pauses, others continue
5. Smooth user experience, reduced abandonment
```

**Implementation Results**:
- 25% reduction in rebuffering events
- 40% faster video start times on mobile
- 15% improvement in user engagement metrics
- 30% reduction in connection establishment time

## Key HTTP/3 Features

### QUIC Transport Layer

- Better congestion control
- Improved loss recovery

### Deployment Considerations
- UDP firewall traversal
- Load balancer compatibility
- CDN support requirements
- Client adoption timeline

## Code Examples
- `http3_connection.py` - HTTP/3 connection establishment and management
- `http3_performance.py` - Performance comparison with HTTP/2
- `http3_migration.py` - Connection migration and resilience features

## Run Instructions
```bash
make test    # Run all HTTP/3 demonstrations
make deps    # Check QUIC and HTTP/2 dependencies
```

HTTP/3 represents the next evolution of web protocols, addressing fundamental transport layer limitations while maintaining HTTP semantics and improving real-world performance, especially for mobile and lossy network environments.
